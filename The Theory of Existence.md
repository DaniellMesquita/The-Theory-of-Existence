# The Theory of Everything

## Demand
A possibility that a person can't be generated again: is infinite the amount of combination of characteristics to create a unique person?
But even being greater and infinite to our vision, those number of variations can be huge, but aren't infinite.
When all example 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 are generated, the demand has been supplied. When there is just a number greater than this, it acts like a reset, and the next numbers are exact as the previous. There can't be equal things at same space/time.

Like as some stars are dead but new ones are generated, the generation of infinite persons and things is unlimited.

## Infinite blockchain
The space-time acts like a infinite blockchain.
When something starts, is because something had ended before.
When you see the genesis block, before it there are other infinite blocks.
And the latest block is connected with other newer blocks you cannot see, but they depends on it.
As for every begin there is a end, for every end there is a new begin.



If you can't born again, then you could not born once.
