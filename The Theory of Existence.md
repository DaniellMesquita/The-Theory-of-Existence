# The Theory of Everything

## Demmand
A possibility that a person can't be generated again: is infinite the amount of combination of characteristics to create a unique person?
But even being greater and infinite to our vision, those number of variations can be huge, but aren't infinite.
When all example 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 are generated, the demmand has been supplied. When there is just a number greater than this, it acts like a reset, and the next numbers are exact as the previous. There can't be equal things at same space/time.

If you can't born again, then you could not born once.
